• Question 1: What is control flow in JavaScript?  Explain how if-else statements work with an example.
-> What is control flow in JavaScript? :- Control flow in JavaScript refers to the order in which the code is executed.
-> Using control flow statements like if-else, switch, for, while, and do-while, you can make decisions and control how the code runs based on certain conditions.
Example :- 
    let age = 20;

    if (age >= 18) {
      console.log("You are eligible to vote.");
    } else {
      console.log("You are not eligible to vote.");
    }

• Question 2: Describe how switch statements work in JavaScript. When should you use a switch statement instead of if-else?
-> What is switch statement in JavaScript? :- A switch statement in JavaScript is used to execute one block of code among multiple options based on the value of a variable or expression.
Example :- 
        let day = "Monday";

        switch (day) {
          case "Monday":
            console.log("Start of the work week.");
            break;
          case "Friday":
            console.log("Weekend is near!");
            break;
          case "Sunday":
            console.log("It's a relaxing day.");
            break;
         default:
           console.log("It's a regular day.");
        }
