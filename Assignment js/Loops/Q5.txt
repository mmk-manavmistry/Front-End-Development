• Question 1: Explain the different types of loops in JavaScript (for, while, do-while). Provide a basic example of each.
-> Types of Loops in JavaScript :- Loops in JavaScript are used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a       specific condition is met. JavaScript provides several types of loops:
->  For Loop
->  While Loop
->  Do-While Loop

-> for Loop Example :- 
                for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
                        console.log(i);
                } Output :- 1,2,3,4,5

-> While Loop Example :- 
                let i = 1;
                while (i <= 5) {
                    console.log(i);
                    i++;
                } Output :- 1,2,3,4,5

-> Do-While Loop :-
                let i = 1;
                do {
                    console.log(i);
                    i++;
                } while (i <= 5); output :- 1,2,3,4,5


• Question 2: What is the difference between a while loop and a do-while loop?
-> while loop :- The condition is checked before the code executes.	
-> do-while loop :- The condition is checked after the code executes.
-> while loop :- No, if the condition is false, the loop body will not run.	
-> do-while loop :- Yes, it will run at least once, even if the condition is false.
-> while loop :- When you are unsure if the loop should execute and it depends on the initial condition.	
-> do-while loop :- When you need to execute the code at least once, regardless of the condition.
