Question 1: What is JavaScript? Explain the role of JavaScript in web development.

-> JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that enables developers to create dynamic and interactive content on web pages. It is one of the core technologies of web development.

-> Client-Side Interactivity :- JavaScript allows developers to add dynamic content such as animations, sliders, pop-ups, and interactive forms.

-> DOM Manipulation :- Using the Document Object Model (DOM), JavaScript can dynamically change HTML and CSS on a webpage without reloading the entire page.

-> Event Handling :- JavaScript can respond to user actions like clicks, keypresses, or form submissions using Event Listeners.

-> Form Validation :- JavaScript ensures that data entered by users is correct before submitting it to the server.

-> Asynchronous Programming :- With technologies like AJAX and Fetch API, JavaScript can fetch data from servers without refreshing the page, making applications more responsive.

-> Backend Development :- Using Node.js, JavaScript can also manage server-side operations like database management, authentication, and API creation.

• Question 2: How is JavaScript different from other programming languages like Python or Java?
JavaScript :- Primarily used for web development (frontend and backend using Node.js).Focuses on creating dynamic and interactive web applications.

Python :- A general-purpose language used for web development (Django, Flask), data analysis, AI, machine learning, and automation.

Java :- Known for building large-scale applications like enterprise software, Android apps, and financial systems.

• Question 3: Discuss the use of <script> tag in HTML. How can you link an external JavaScript file to an HTML document?

-> Internal JavaScript :- JavaScript code is written directly within the <script> tag in the HTML document.

External JavaScript :- JavaScript is stored in a separate .js file, and the <script> tag is used to link to that file using the src attribute.

->Internal example :- 
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html lang="en">
        <head>
          <meta charset="UTF-8" />
          <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
          <title>Internal JavaScript Example</title>
        </head>
        <body>
         <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
          <button onclick="greetUser()">Click Me</button>

          <script>
            function greetUser() {
              alert("Hello! Welcome to the website.");
            }
          </script>
        </body>
        </html>

-> External Example :- 
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
      <meta charset="UTF-8" />
     <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
      <title>External JavaScript Example</title>
    </head>
    <body>
      <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
      <button onclick="greetUser()">Click Me</button>
     <script src="script.js"></script>
    </body>
    </html>
